# TIC-TAC-TOE
This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed during my internship at Prodify Infotech. The project helped me enhance my web development skills by creating an interactive and responsive game that runs smoothly on any modern browser. The game allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O" symbols. The design features a vibrant gradient background, smooth animations, and a user-friendly interface that adapts well to different screen sizes, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Additionally, the game includes a reset button for starting a new round without refreshing the page. This project provided valuable experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, reinforcing my ability to create engaging and functional web applications.
